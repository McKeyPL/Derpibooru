        <h3>Search basics</h3>
        <p>Derpibooru\'s search engine is based on the tags associated with the uploaded images. A
        search for <strong>pinkie pie</strong>, for example, yields the entries featuring Pinkie Pie.</p>
        <p>Separate multiple tags with a comma or <strong>&&</strong>. The queries are not case sensitive â€” the
        capitalization does not matter.</p>
        <p>You can mark the tags you do not want to appear with either <strong>!</strong> or <strong>-</strong>:<br>
        <strong>!fluttershy</strong> or <strong>-fluttershy</strong> matches pictures that do not feature Fluttershy.</p>
        <p>To request uploads that meet only a part of the criteria, use the disjunction (OR expression)
        specified with <strong>||</strong>, and separate the subexpressions with parentheses.</p>
        <p>Consider the following example: <strong>(twilight sparkle || fluttershy) && pinkie pie</strong> returns results that have
		either Twilight Sparkle or Fluttershy, and always Pinkie Pie.</p>
