# The Derpibooru Mobile Client for Android

### Important notice

I stopped maintaining this application a while ago, and the most up-to-date version available is not compatible with the latest changes to the Derpibooru API.

However, [@auzbuzzard](https://github.com/auzbuzzard) is maintaining a **[fully-functional fork](https://github.com/auzbuzzard/Derpibooru)** that addresses critical issues ([#28](https://github.com/deliciousblackink/Derpibooru/issues/28)) and aims to continue future development. Please note that if you're updating an old version obtained from this repository, you need to uninstall it first before running the latest APK.

### Overview

The application brings convenient (and fast!) access to the booru on mobile devices. Its user interface follows the Material Design [guidelines](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) to create a familiar environment for Android users.

It is available as a side-load [APK](https://github.com/deliciousblackink/Derpibooru/releases).

### Requirements

The minimum Android version required is Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0.3 (API 15).
